1.0
-------------------------

- moved code out of py-1.1.1 into its own plugin
- use a new, faster and more sensible model to do load-balancing 
  of tests - now no magic "MAXITEMSPERHOST" is needed and load-testing
  works effectively even with very few tests. 
- cleaned up termination handling 
- make -x cause hard killing of test nodes to decrease wait time 
  until the traceback shows up on first failure
